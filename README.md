Genetic algorithm and neural networks

Genetic algorithm - With the help of a genetic algorithm for a function, it is necessary to determine the global minimum and the global maximum.

Neural networks - It is necessary to design and train a neural network that will determine the speed and angle at which the robot should throw the ball at different distances from the basket, as well as at different distances of the basketball player from the robot trying to block the robot's shot, so that a hit is always scored.
